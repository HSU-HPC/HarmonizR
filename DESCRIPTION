Description: An implementation, which takes input data and makes it available
    for proper batch effect removal by ComBat or Limma. The implementation appropriately
    handles missing values by dissecting the input matrix into smaller matrices
    with sufficient data to feed the ComBat or limma algorithm. The adjusted 
    data is returned to the user as a rebuild matrix. The implementation is 
    meant to make as much data available as possible with minimal data loss.
