#' Creating a binary existence matrix
#'
#' This function reduces its input matrix to a binary existence matrix based on
#' the given description file (and information on how many values a batch needs)
#' for proper adjustment.
#'
#' @param binary_data The input data.frame that should become binary.
#' @param batch_list Information about the sample's batch affiliations.
#' @param needed_values Information, how many values are needed to render a
#' a batch 'valid'.
#' @return A binary existence matrix returned as a data.frame


# ----- binary_matrix_reduction(binary_data, batch_list, needed_values) -------
# This function expects a binary matrix itself as input. This usually 
# means that all values are turned to 1 and all NAs are turned to 0. 
# This function returns a binary data.frame reduced to information for full 
# batches. The function is similar but not identical to what is found in 
# 'spotting_missing_values.r'.
