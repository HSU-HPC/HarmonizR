#' Blocking
#'
#' This function performs blocking on the given description and therefore 
#' influences how the dataset will be split later down the pipeline.
#'
#' @param batch_list The list with information about batch-affiliations for 
#' every sample.
#' @param block The blocking parameter (how many batches should always get
#' blocked together).
#' @return Returns an updated 'batch_list' with blocking included
